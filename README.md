# electronic driver's logbook

This project involves an iOS and Android app designed as a driver’s logbook. The app communicates with an ELM327 adapter connected to the vehicle’s OBD-II port by using Bluetooth Low Energy.

The main advantage of this application is that it runs automatically in the background on both mobile platforms. Apart from the initial setup, no user interaction is required.

The focus of the project was on functionality and usability, rather than clean or optimized code.
